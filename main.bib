These methods make use of summations of ring and chain cluster diagrams. The summations are performed explicitly for certain classes of molecular models. The molecules in these classes contain several ``interaction sites,'' and the total interaction between two molecules is a sum of site‐site potentials that depend on the scalar distances between sites on the two molecules. The principal results of this work are computationally simple techniques for calculating the thermo‐dynamic properties and pair correlation functions of molecular fluids in which the intermolecular interactions are highly angular dependent. The techniques should be reliable since they arise from the same approximations that have been shown to be very accurate when applied to simple fluids.},

	abstract = {A generalization of the {RISM} integral equation for site–site pair correlation functions previously proposed by us is discussed and applied to model liquids composed of strongly polar diatomic molecules. The nonuniform molecular charge distribution is represented by the introduction of charged interaction sites. The generalization consists of applying closure conditions analogous to those which are known to be reasonable for the description of atomic ionic fluids, and the corresponding renormalization of the contributions arising from long range forces. We discuss both the symmetry properties of the pair correlation functions in special cases and the dielectric properties implied by theory. Applications are presented for three two‐site models which differ substantially in the degree of asymmetry of the {non‐Coulombic} potential between the two sites, and for three three‐site models for Br2. The two sites models are compared to computer simulation results, and those for Br2 to experimental results. The analysis shows that the integral equation is well balanced in that in every case the qualitative features of the liquids structure which are introduced by polarity are well represented, even in cases where the site–site potentials are individually much larger than {kBT.} In cases where the molecular shape and polar forces are in competition, the results are of comparable accuracy to the corresponding theory for nonpolar systems. In the extreme case where changes in orientational structure can occur without interfering with packing requirements, the results appear quantitatively less reliable.},

The latter model includes a van der Waals repulsion between the oxygen (O) and hydrogen (H) atoms, which is necessary for the implementation of some integral equation theories. Two integral equation theories, the reference interaction site model ({RISM)} and the diagrammatically proper {Chandler–Silbey–Ladanyi} ({CSL)} theory, are tested by comparison with simulations of the {MSPC} model (neither theory converges for the {SPC} model when the hypernetted chain closure is used). The {RISM} theory is in reasonable agreement with simulations, and is more accurate than the {CSL} theory. A density functional theory ({DFT)} is investigated, which treats the ideal gas functional exactly and uses a truncated expansion for the excess free energy functional. The {DFT} is in excellent agreement with simulations for the structure of the {MSPC} water model at all temperatures studied, and for the structure of the {SPC} water model at high temperatures. At room temperature, the {DFT} is in good agreement with simulations (of {SPC} water) for {gHH(r)} and {gOH(r)}, but misses the location of the second peak in {gOO(r).} We attribute this deficiency to the importance of three-body correlations that are not properly incorporated in the theory. © 2003 American Institute of Physics.},

D. Chandler et al., Mol. Phys. 46, 1335 (1982)
]. The resulting functions are then used to diagrammatically renormalize the molecular fluid theory. A result is that the diagrammatically proper interaction site model theory is shown to be a linearized, minimal angular basis set approximation to this site-renormalized molecular theory. This framework is used to propose a new, exact, and proper closure to the diagrammatically proper interaction site model theory. The resulting equation system contains a bridge function expansion in the proper site-site theory. In addition, the construction of the theory is such that the molecular pair distribution function, in full dimensionality, is intrinsic to the theory. Furthermore, the theory is equivalent to the molecular Ornstein-Zernike treatment of site-site molecules in the basis set expansion of 
Blum and Torruella [J. Chem. Phys. 56, 303 (1971)]
. A significant formal result of the theory is the demonstration that certain classes of diagrams which would otherwise be considered improper in the interaction site model formalism are included in the angular expansion of molecular interactions. Numerical results for several apolar homonuclear models and an apolar heteronuclear model are shown to quantitatively improve upon those of reference interaction site model and our recent proper variant with respect to simulation. Significant numerical results are that the various thermodynamic quantities obey the exact symmetries and sum rules within numerical error for the different sites in the heteronuclear case, even for the low order approximation used in this work, and the theory is independent of the so-called auxiliary site problem common to previous site-site theories.},

A rather simple property of the angular coupling coefficients of our former work allows us to write the {Ornstein‐Zernike} equation in irreducible form, as a set of uncoupled matrix equations, of rather small size. A generalization of Baxter's form of the {Ornstein‐Zernike} equation to matrices allows us to write a formal solution to the mean spherical model of neutral hard spheres with almost arbitrary electrostatic multipoles. This is an extension of Wertheim's solution for dipoles [J. Chem. Phys. 55, 4291 (1971)]. The formal solution consists in showing that the direct correlation function inside the hard core is a polynomial in the interatomic distance r. The coefficients of the polynomials are obtained by solving a set of quadratic matrix equations. The class of potentials that admit this kind of a solution is larger than the electrostatic multipole interaction but does not include some cross interactions like the dipole‐quadrupole interaction.},

The quality of the results obtained within the {HNC} approximation is discussed by comparison with values from molecular dynamics ({MD)} simulations. The {MOZ-HNC} theory yields internal excess energies and dielectric constants which are about 20\% smaller than the simulation results found in the literature. The relative trends of the properties observed by simulation for the different interaction models are correctly predicted. In order to calculate the rotational invariant coefficients which define the liquid structure, new {MD} simulations were carried out. The rotational invariant coefficients derived from the simulation and from the {MOZ} theory strongly differ. In particular, the center–center distribution functions show that the theory is not able to reproduce the tetrahedral structure of water. In this solvent a comparison of the {O–H} distribution function indicates that the {MOZ} theory underestimates the H bonding. The use of a spherically symmetric bridge function in the reference {HNC} approximation does not lead to an improvement of the {MOZ} results. The observed defects of the {MOZ-HNC} approach contrast with the good agreement found for aprotic solvents and are presumably due to the association by H bonds in water and methanol. © 1999 American Institute of Physics.},

In particular, a modified {Poisson?Boltzmann} ({PB)} equation is derived in which the mobile dipoles provide an effective spatially dependent dielectric constant. This equation implies a self-consistent iteration procedure by which the monopole and dipole densities are simultaneously determined in terms of single scalar ({PB)} field. Moreover, this equation can be derived from a minimum principle; an annealing strategy for computing the {PB} field is thereby suggested. In addition, explicit mean-field expressions for thermodynamic free energies are obtained as simple functionals of the {PB} field. Connection to the well-known Langevin dipole model is made.

	abstract = {We present a novel quenched solid density functional theory ({QSDFT)} model of adsorption on heterogeneous surfaces and porous solids, which accounts for the effects of surface roughness and microporosity. Within {QSDFT}, solid atoms are considered as quenched component(s) of the solid?fluid system with given density distribution(s). Solid?fluid intermolecular interactions are split into hard-sphere repulsive and mean-field attractive parts. The former are treated with the multicomponent fundamental measure density functional. Capabilities of {QSDFT} are demonstrated by drawing on the example of adsorption on amorphous silica materials. We show that, using established intermolecular potentials and a realistic model for silica surfaces, {QSDFT} quantitatively describes adsorption/desorption isotherms of Ar and Kr on reference {MCM-41}, {SBA-15}, and {LiChrosphere} materials in a wide range of relative pressures. {QSDFT} offers a systematic approach to the practical problems of characterization of microporous, mesoporous, and amorphous silica materials, including an assessment of microporosity, surface roughness, and adsorption deformation. Predictions for the pore diameter and the extent of pore surface roughness in {MCM-41} and {SBA-15} materials are in very good agreement with recent X-ray diffraction studies.},

We revealed that the macroscopic and microscopic theories are in quantitative agreement for the pores {\textgreater}8 nm diameter within the whole range of adsorbate pressures.

Both solute?solvent electrostatic and van der Waals interactions are fully included, and solvent packing is taken into account. The approach is illustrated by calculating the average oxygen and hydrogen density of liquid water around two molecular solutes:? water and N-methylacetamide. Molecular dynamics simulations are performed to test the results obtained from the integral equation. It is observed that important microscopic structural features of the average water density due to hydrogen bonding are reproduced by the integral equation. The integral equation has a simple formal structure and is easy to implement numerically. It offers a powerful alternative to computer simulations with explicit solvent molecules and to continuum solvent representations for incorporating solvation effects in a wide range of applications.},

The first step is to obtain the pair correlation functions for solutions consisting of water and ligands based on the {RISM} theory. Then, given the pair correlation functions prepared in the first step, we calculate the {3D-distribution} functions of water and ligands around and inside protein based on the {3D-RISM} theory. The molecular recognition of a ligand by the protein is realized by the {3D-distribution} functions: if one finds some conspicuous peaks in the distribution of a ligand inside protein, then the ligand is regarded as ?recognized? by the protein. Some biochemical processes are investigated, which are intimately related to the molecular recognition of small ligands including water, noble gases, and ions by a protein.},

	abstract = {We describe a new way to calculate the electrostatic properties of macromolecules that goes beyond the classical Poisson-Boltzmann treatment with only a small extra {CPU} cost. The solvent region is no longer modeled as a homogeneous dielectric media but rather as an assembly of self-orienting interacting dipoles of variable density. The method effectively unifies both the Poisson-centric view and the Langevin Dipole model. The model results in a variable dielectric constant ε ( r → ) in the solvent region and also in a variable solvent density ρ ( r → ) that depends on the nature of the closest exposed solute atoms. The model was calibrated using small molecules and ions solvation data with only two adjustable parameters, namely the size and dipolar moment of the solvent. Hydrophobicity scales derived from the solvent density profiles agree very well with independently derived hydrophobicity scales, both at the atomic or residue level. Dimerization interfaces in homodimeric proteins or lipid-binding regions in membrane proteins clearly appear as poorly solvated patches on the solute accessible surface. Comparison of the thermally averaged solvent density of this model with the one derived from molecular dynamics simulations shows qualitative agreement on a coarse-grained level. Because this calculation is much more rapid than that from molecular dynamics, applications of a density-profile-based solvation energy to the identification of the true structure among a set of decoys become computationally feasible. Various possible improvements of the model are discussed, as well as extensions of the formalism to treat mixtures of dipolar solvents of different sizes.},

	abstract = {We present a statistical field theory to describe large length scale effects induced by solutes in a cold and otherwise placid liquid. The theory divides space into a cubic grid of cells. The side length of each cell is of the order of the bulk correlation length of the bulk liquid. Large length scale states of the cells are specified with an Ising variable. Finer length scale effects are described with a Gaussian field, with mean and variance affected by both the large length scale field and by the constraints imposed by solutes. In the absence of solutes and corresponding constraints, integration over the Gaussian field yields an effective lattice-gas Hamiltonian for the large length scale field. In the presence of solutes, the integration adds additional terms to this Hamiltonian. We identify these terms analytically. They can provoke large length scale effects, such as the formation of interfaces and depletion layers. We apply our theory to compute the reversible work to form a bubble in liquid water, as a function of the bubble radius. Comparison with molecular simulation results for the same function indicates that the theory is reasonably accurate. Importantly, simulating the large length scale field involves binary arithmetic only. It thus provides a computationally convenient scheme to incorporate explicit solvent dynamics and structure in simulation studies of large molecular assemblies.},

The solvation properties of an arbitrary solute in a given solvent, both described by a molecular force field, can be obtained by minimization of a position- and orientation-dependent free-energy density functional. In the homogeneous reference fluid approximation, the unknown excess term of the functional can be approximated by the angular-dependent direct correlation function of the pure solvent. This function can be extracted from a preliminary {MD} simulation of the pure solvent by computing the angular-dependent pair distribution function and solving subsequently the molecular {Ornstein?Zernike} equation. The corresponding functional can then be minimized on a three-dimensional cubic grid for positions and a {Gauss?Legendre} angular grid for orientations to provide the solvation free energy of embedded molecules at the same time as the solvent three-dimensional microscopic structure. This functional minimization procedure is much more efficient than direct molecular dynamics simulations combined with thermodynamic integration schemes. The approach is shown to be also pertinent to the molecular-level determination of electron-transfer properties such as reaction free energy and reorganization energy. It is illustrated for molecular solvation and photochemical electron-transfer reactions in acetonitrile, a prototypical polar aprotic solvent.},

This implicit solvent method allows for the determination of structural, orientational, and energetic solvation properties that are on a par with all-atom molecular simulations performed for the same system, while reducing the computer time by two orders of magnitude. This is illustrated by the study of an atomistically-resolved clay surface composed of over a thousand atoms wetted by a molecular dipolar solvent. The high numerical efficiency of the method is exploited to carry a systematic analysis of the electrostatic and non-electrostatic components of the surface-solvent interaction within the popular Clay Force Field ({CLAYFF).} Solvent energetics and structure are found to depend weakly upon the atomic charges distribution of the clay surface, even for a rather polar solvent. We conclude on the consequences of such findings for force-field development.},

The requisite averages over the {ISM} fluids are calculated by the extended reference interaction site method ({XRISM)} using site–site hypernetted chain ({HNC)‐like} closures modified to reproduce the correct long‐range behavior of the site–site pair correlation functions. They are compared with averages over the {ΩM} models under the {RHNC} theory taken from the literature or calculated under the mean spherical approximation. We find for fluids of strong enough polarity that {ϵL(k)} is negative over a finite range of k, the low end being in agreement with recent computer simulation studies of both {ISM} and {ΩM} polar fluids. However, we confirm that the expected large‐k behavior {ϵL(k)=1} governs the {ISMs}, but not the {ΩM} models. Based on an adaptation of the color charge–color field techniques of molecular dynamics, we develop the concept of the color longitudinal dielectric function; it provides useful information about the role of the spatial extent of the molecular charge distribution on the behavior of {ϵL(k).} The {ISM} fluids we have analyzed include dipolar dumbbells over a wide range of bond length and polarity as well as realistic interaction site models for water and methanol. For the methanol model, we compare our {ϵL(k)} with recent computer simulation results and find substantial agreement.},

In this work we evaluate {ϵT(k)} for models of two classes. (1) In a {DS} model each molecule is a hard sphere with a point dipole at its center. It is the simplest representative of models in which the long range intermolecular interactions are generated by a set of point multipoles located at a single point in the molecule. In this case {ST(k)} is {SM,T(k)}, the static correlation function of the transverse part of the dipole polarization density M(k). (2) In a {ζDS} model fluid, comprising nonideal dipolar hard spheres, the long range interactions are accounted for by two opposite partial charges on either side of the sphere’s center and separated by a distance l. The {ζDS} model is the simplest interaction site model ({ISM)} of a polar fluid. For an {ISM} the relevant structure factor {ST(k)} is {SPμ} {,T(k)}, the static correlation of the transverse part of the full electric polarization density vector Pμ(k). Here we compare {ϵT(k)} for {DS} and {ζDS} models with the help of the mean spherical approximation for the required structure functions. The {ζDS–DS} difference in {ϵT(k)} at large k is found to parallel the behavior of the static longitudinal dielectric function {ϵL(k).} However, {ϵT(k)}, unlike {ϵL(k)}, is a damped oscillatory function of k with no poles on the real k axis.},

	abstract = {The longitudinal frequency and wave-vector dependent complex dielectric response function χ(k,ω)=1−1/ϵ(k,ω) is calculated in a broad range of k values by means of molecular dynamics computer simulation for a central force model of water. Its imaginary part, i.e.,  Im\{ϵ(k,ω)\}/∣ϵ(k,ω)∣2, shows two main contributions in the region of small k values: Debye-like orientational relaxation in the lower frequency part of the spectrum and a damped librational resonance at the high frequency wing. The Debye relaxation time does not follow a de Gennes-like pattern: τ(k) goes through a maximum at k≈k∗≈1.7 Å−1, while the static polar structure factor S(k) peaks at k≈3 Å−1. The resonance frequency ω(k) and the decay decrement γ(k) show a dispersion law, indicative of a decaying optical-like mode, the libron. With an approximate normal mode approach, we analyze the origin of this mode on a molecular level which shows that it is due to a damped propagation of molecular orientational vibrations through the network of hydrogen bonds. At high k the decay, due to dissipation of collective into single particle motions, dominates. The static dielectric function is calculated on the basis of the response function spectra via the {Kramers–Kronig} relation. In the small k region ϵ(k) decreases from the macroscopic value ϵ≈80 to a value ≈15, i.e. it exhibits a Lorentzian-type behavior. This behavior is shown to be determined by higher order multipole correlation functions. In the intermediate and high k range, our results on ϵ(k) and χ(k) are in excellent agreement with data extracted from experimental partial pair correlation functions: ϵ(k) exhibits two divergence points on the k axis with a range of negative values in between where a maximum in χ(k) is found with χmax(k)≫1, indicative of overscreening. Consequences of quantum corrections to χ(k) with respect to a purely classical calculation are discussed and consequences are shown for the interaction energy between hydrated ions. © 1998 American Institute of Physics.},

	abstract = {A free energy model for the inhomogeneous hard‐sphere fluid mixture was derived recently [Phys. Rev. Lett. 63, 980 (1989)], which is based on the fundamental geometric measures of the particles. Along with an updated assessment of its accuracy, this model is first generalized for charged hard‐sphere fluid mixtures, in which every particle carries a central Yukawa charge, and it is then extended to general fluid mixtures in external fields. The Yukawa‐charged hard‐sphere mixture provides a quite general reference system for many interesting physical systems including plasmas, molten salts, and colloidal dispersions, the screening parameter enabling to interpolate between the long range Coulomb forces and the short range hard cores. A special renormalization property of the Yukawa potential provides the means to derive the exact Onsager‐type lower bound for the potential energy of the mixture, and its related asymptotic strong‐coupling limit of the liquid pair correlation functions. These results are obtained analytically for the general homogeneous mixture with Yukawa interactions. They enable to extend the fundamental measure free energy model to inhomogeneous charged Yukawa mixtures, with the charge contributions given by a truncated second order expansion from the uniform (bulk) fluid {limit.The} resulting free energy model, which interpolates between the ideal‐gas and ‘‘ideal‐liquid’’ limits, then leads to a self‐consistent method for calculating the density profiles for general fluid mixtures in external fields. This method is equivalent to an ansatz of ‘‘universality of the bridge functional.’’ The ‘‘bridge functional’’ consists of all the terms beyond the second order, in the expansion of the excess free energy functional around a reference uniform fluid. The self‐consistency is imposed by applying the general method in the special case when the external potential is generated by a ‘‘test particle’’ at the origin of coordinates. In this limit, our general method for nonuniform fluids corresponds to an established and successful theory for the bulk uniform fluid pair structure, namely the thermodynamically consistent modified‐hypernetted‐chain theory, with the bridge functions now generated by an explicit and demonstratively accurate, ‘‘universal,’’ hard‐sphere bridge functional. As a stringent test for the general model, the strongly coupled one‐component plasma, in the bulk and near a hard wall, is considered in some detail.},

The free energy functional describing the inhomogeneous solution includes the best available fundamental measure description of excluded volume correlations in a ternary mixture of hard spheres, whereas all electrostatic and cohesive interactions are treated within the mean-field approximation. We find both first and second order wetting transitions which are rather little affected by ions at low and moderate concentrations, compared to the wetting behavior of the pure solvent. A novel drying scenario is predicted, where complete drying is prevented by the electrostatic attraction between a positively charged substrate and the anions, while near a negatively charged substrate, a first order transition with a predrying line is observed. The various scenarios are surprisingly similar to our previous predictions based on a “semiprimitive” model where the solvent particles carry no dipole, but the ion-ion interactions are reduced by a local dielectric permittivity.},

	abstract = {The direct correlation function ({DCF)} plays a pivotal role in addressing the thermodynamic properties with non-mean-field statistical theories of liquid state. This work provides an accurate yet efficient calculation procedure for evaluating the angular-dependent {DCF} of bulk {SPC/E} water. The {DCF} here represented in a discrete angles basis is computed with two typical steps: the first step involves solving the molecular Ornstein-Zernike equation with the input of total correlation function extracted from simulation; the resultant {DCF} is then polished in second step at small wavelength for all orientations in order to match correct thermodynamic properties. This function is also discussed in terms of its rotational invariant components. In particular, we show that the component c112(r) that accounts for dipolar symmetry reaches already its long-range asymptotic behavior at a short distance of 4 Å. With the knowledge of {DCF}, the angular-dependent bridge function of bulk water is thereafter computed and discussed in comparison with referenced hard-sphere bridge functions. We conclude that, even though such hard-sphere bridge functions may be relevant to improve the calculation of Helmholtz free energies in integral equations or density functional theory, they are doomed to fail at a structural level.},
